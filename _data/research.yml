  description: "I am working on utilizing Deep RL techniques for CPU and memory (cluster scheduling) resource management
                and job scheduling. So far, Iâ€™ve implemented a simple environment with two resources,
                e.g., CPU and memory, to schedule non-preemptive jobs. The agent learns to schedule jobs with PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm.
                Our goal is to improve this environment to have more complex features such as preemption, job fragmentation, etc.
                <br>My research is under the supervision of Professor <a href=\"https://mrheidar.ir/\">Heidarpour</a>."
